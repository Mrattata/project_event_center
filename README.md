This is my Event Center webiste project.
The theme is neon lights, raves, and rock n roll.
There are 5 pages (home, events, contact, location, and menu).
This project is useful as a framework for other front end website development. 
Images were obtained from StockCake.com
The code used to build this website is HTML and CSS
To use this code use VS Code or an online compiler.
